C++20 modern general-purpose production-ready Windows-only(by now) framework Aurora

The file Engine/Behaviour.hpp is not documented since its usage is meant for the users.

Certain files such as Core/Exception.hpp and Core/Intrinsics.hpp are not documented since its usage is not meant to be available for the general public, but more for internal functionalities.

Remember, anything that's not documented isn't meant to be used by you.

The documentation is embedded inside the folder Documentation/html, however, an only-docs repository can be found at <a href="https://github.com/SamuelAlonsoDev/AuroraDocs">here</a>, and the documentation website at <a href="https://samuelalonsodev.github.io/AuroraDocs/">here</a>.

# Aurora: What & why?

Aurora is an inclusive production-ready C++20 framework, which will simplify the process of creating high-performance, reliable, and secure applications, no matter what your technical level is.


The industry needs Aurora, as the number of over-complex libraries on the C++ community is still bigger than the number of libraries which rather prefer to make it easier for everyone.


But also, Aurora needs the industry, because at the core of any project, is its community.


Therefore, we would love to build a sane community driven by the idea of making astonishing projects with it!


So, don't have any fear to share me any kind of project you are developing/publishing to samuelalonsocpp@gmail.com


Cheers!
