The file Engine/Behaviour.hpp is not documented since its usage is meant for the users.

Certain files such as Core/Exception.hpp and Core/Intrinsics.hpp are not documented since its usage is not meant to be available for the general public, but more for internal functionalities.

Remember, anything that's not documented isn't meant to be used by you.

The documentation is embedded inside the folder Documentation/html, however, an only-docs repository can be found at <a href="https://github.com/SamuelAlonsoDev/AuroraDocs">here</a>, and the documentation website at <a href="https://samuelalonsodev.github.io/AuroraDocs/">here</a>.
